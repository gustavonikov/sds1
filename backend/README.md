### Starting
You must have installed in your computer, the JDK version 11, PostgreSQL database (which you have to create a database name with the same name that's in 
the project or change in the name in the project)
and the Spring Tool Suite with vscode, eclipse or another IDE.

### How to use
There are 3 environments to run in this server: test, dev and prod.
Currently prod is activated, but in the file named "application.properties" on src/main/resources, change the spring.profiles.active to your desired environment.

After you do the initial configuration to run the project, you are good to go, just press Run in your IDE.
